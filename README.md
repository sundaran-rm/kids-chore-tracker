# kids-chore-tracker
Tracks the daily chores and rewards for Kids

## How to Use
  This is a static page and nothing is stored in it. So after opening the page and adding all the values, click 'Export JSON' to save a local copy. Load up the local copy using 'Import JSON' to resume where you left off.

## Tips and Tricks
  For now there is no feature to add Kids name (will be added in the future). To overcome that, when exporting JSON, please append your kids name to the file name to track for multiple kids.
